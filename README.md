# spotify-currently-playing

<samp>

This is a simple web application that showcases the song currently playing on Spotify by leveraging Spotify's Web API to fetch and display this information in real-time on a webpage. You can see a live demonstration of this feature on <a href="https://thesegunonakoya.vercel.app" target="_blank">my portfolio</a>, where the header dynamically updates to show what I am currently listening to.
