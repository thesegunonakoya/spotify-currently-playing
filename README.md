# spotify-currently-playing

<samp>

This project is a serverless function i deployed on Vercel that fetches and returns information about the track currently playing on my Spotify. It utilizes the Spotify API to retrieve real-time data about the currently playing track. You can see a live demo of this feature on <a href="https://thesegunonakoya.me" target="_blank">my personal website</a>, where a scrolling text in the header dynamically updates to show what I am currently listening to on my Spotify and unlike you, i have a very good taste in music.

## Features

<samp>

- Displays whatever song you are currently playing on your Spotify no matter how boring or weird it is.
- Updates the display in real-time to reflect any changes in the currently playing song when the page is refreshed or reloaded.
- Deployed as a serverless function on Vercel, allowing for scalability and minimal maintenance.
- With an additional greeting message based on the time of day to make you seem a bit polite even though you are not ( for example "I'm currently listening to 'Wells Fargo' by Vibez Inc ðŸŽ§ ðŸ“€ How's your night going? ðŸŽˆ").
